Player Ability Manager: This script holds all player abilities and their relative variables, when the player uses an ability button it will send the string name of the ability, the ability manager will use the string to call the relative ability function. Once called the ability does its respective function along with some base functions shared by all of them such as animation, sound and cooldown activation. An example of a unique ability function is combustion, this ability will search the room for targets and find the nearest one, once found it will activate the combust status effect on the target, if it failed to find a usable target then the ability enters a half duration cooldown. Another ability is dodge, this will fire a ray in the direction of the player's movement up to 7 units, if the ray hits a target then the player will teleport to that position, if the ray manages to travel 7 units then the player teleports to the end position.
